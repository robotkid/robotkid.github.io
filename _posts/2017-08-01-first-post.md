This is the first post on my newly minted 'thinkstuff' blog. I thought I'd start with a brief overview of how I set up the site.

_Thinkstuff_ is being hosted on [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=e5276286b72b18b86c99cad198944d0fbb83e4d6). I'm running Ubuntu 16.04LTS on a Linode 1024 instance at $5/month. This server size is the smallest and cheapest that Linode offers, and I wasn't sure if running a full Wordpress install would be that great on this system, so I opted for a static blog, which is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
